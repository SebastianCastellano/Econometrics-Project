The main objective of this report is to analyze how the VKOSPI (Stock Market Implied Volatility Index of South Korea) is influenced by macroeconomic and financial variables and to find the best model to predict its future values. In order to do this we compare different types of econometric models and statistical tests such as ordinary linear regression, HAR, ARCH and GARCH models.
